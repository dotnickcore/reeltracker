/*
  React components are reusable, self-contained building blocks that define the UI by managing their own state and rendering based on props. 
  They can be functional or class-based, with functional components being more common due to their simplicity and support for hooks.

/*
  Props (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed to React components to customize their behavior and appearance. 
  They allow data to flow from parent to child components, enabling reusability and dynamic rendering.
